'This program is a simple example of a Python program that uses the requests library to make a GET request to a web server.'
import requests # Import the requests library

response = requests.get('http://www.google.com') # Make a GET request to the Google home page
print(response.text) # Print the response from the server

# This program will print the HTML of the Google home page to the console.
# To run this program, you will need to have the requests library installed.
# You can install it with the following command:
# pip install requests
# Then you can run the program with the following command:
# python3 requests_example.py
# You should see the HTML of the Google home page printed to the console.
# If you want to save the HTML to a file, you can redirect the output to a file like this:
# python3 requests_example.py > google.html
# This will save the HTML to a file named google.html in the current directory.
# You can then open the file in a web browser to view the HTML.
# This program is a simple example of how you can use the requests library to make HTTP requests in Python.
# You can use it to make GET requests to any web server that supports HTTP.
# You can also make POST requests, PUT requests, DELETE requests, and more.
# The requests library makes it easy to work with HTTP in Python.
# You can use it to interact with web APIs, scrape web pages, and more.
# For more information on the requests library, see the official documentation:
# https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/   
# For more information on HTTP, see the HTTP/1.1 specification:
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616
# For more information on web servers, see the Apache HTTP Server documentation:
